This project utilizes a comprehensive dataset of banking client interactions to analyze and predict customer behavior regarding term deposits. The dataset comprises 11,162 entries, detailing various aspects of clients, such as age, job, marital status, education, and contact information, enriched with insights from previous marketing campaigns.

The primary objective of this project is to develop machine learning models capable of predicting whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit, enabling more targeted and efficient marketing strategies. We employ a variety of statistical tests and predictive algorithms to identify key factors influencing client decisions.
